<h1> Philosophers </h1>

<i>This project was made at the 42 school context.</i><br>
<br>
The project involves simulating a scenario with philosophers sitting at a round table,
eating spaghetti. The simulation must be implemented <b>using threads and mutexes in C.</b>
The philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping,
and the goal is to prevent them from starving.
The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation or, optionally, when all philosophers have eaten a specified number of times.
